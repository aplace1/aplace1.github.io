# Self-Assessment

Completing the coursework within the computer science program alongside
creating the ePortfolio has helped me by providing a basic understanding of
many concepts to build upon. Specific examples would be learning OpenGL,
Embedded devices, Client and Server Development, an introduction to
reverse engineering, and Collaboration and Team Projects.

During this subset of classes, In the computer visualizations course with
OpenGL, we used several C++ libraries to build a 3D environment with shaders
and a controllable camera.

In the embedded devices course, I obtained a new perspective on how
micro-controllers are programmed. Everything from a basic clock to a router.
I was learning more about state-machines, Embedded-C, and how I could implement
them onto a Texas Instruments CC3220S.

Within Client and server Development I was shown a new form of databases,
non-relational databases. Two of my GitHub projects contain non-relational
databases and one is the primary artifact I will be discussing.

The introductory course to reverse engineering provided both a hobby and a
new outlook on how code is compiled. From this newfound hobby, I have realized
the intricacies of protecting a program's integrity. Each instruction denoted by
bytes may be read or manipulated to change the control flow.

Lastly, the collaborative team environment explained the importance of Git and
how to use it for both personal and group projects. I primarily access git
through the terminal and utilize it regularly.

# New Artifact Summary

<a href="https://github.com/aplace1/Jukebox-Capstone-Artifact" class="btn">Jukebox Project</a>

The new artifact I am adding to my portfolio is a combination of two seperate projects.

**CS-310 Collaboration and Team Project**, and
**CS-250 Software Development Life-cycle** (SDLC).

The first project was a simple text-based Jukebox that used a queue data
structure to display data from a LinkedList or playlist. The second project was
a graphical slideshow of travel destinations. I wanted to include these
projects to demonstrate my aptitude for developing secure, clean, and reusable
code.

Briefly, I modularized and refactored the Slideshow project so that it would be
able to emulate the functionality of a jukebox/music player. It can now connect
and query a group of randomly selected records from a database and can display
a picture (cover art) based on the genre of the currently playing song. It also
shows the artist and song name.

The Queue based structure was swapped out for a circular doubly linked list
allowing backwards and forwards traversal to and from the last and first song in
the playlist. This acts as a looping mechanic within the program.
